# Things I Learned

## Been working on Rust for 8 years

- 

## Exploration / Iteration

- Research spiral?
- Rust's Parallel Story
    - Rayon
    - Tasks
    - Borrow check
    - IMHTWAMA
    - Pythonesque
    - Rayon

## Integration

- I spent a lot of time reading and learning
  about type systems
- Left me blind to some problems
    - not saying that these are unstudied =)
- semver
    - explain how traits and type classes work
    - explain "the hashtable problem"
    - talk about the haskell term: coherence
    - orphan rule
    - little orphan impl considerations
    - rebalancing coherence
    - still a "live problem" today
- "what is simple"
    - lambda calculus can be defined in two rules
        - but try to program in it
        - seems like an abstract problem?
    - what is explicit
        - Rust uses `Result` for error handling
        - elegant, minimal, but try programming in it
        - early stab: the `try!` macro
        - introducing the `?` operator
        - the debate rages:
            - too hard to see!
            - maybe we should use monads?
                - connected to "true artists ship"
    - Stroustroup's rule
    - borrow check
        - initial version with scoped rules
        - new version with NLL rules
        - polonius
        - going further
    - Ergonomics
- Two things academics 
    - semver
        - impl and forwards compat
        - inference locality and impls
    
- Ergonomics

## Iteration and stability

- Train model

- Unsafe code guidelines
